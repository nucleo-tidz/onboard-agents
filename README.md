# Onboarding Multi-Agent AI with Semantic Kernel

## Overview

This project demonstrates a Proof of Concept (PoC) for an AI-powered onboarding system using Microsoft Semantic Kernel with multiple agents working in orchestration. It automates key onboarding steps for new employees:

- **EmailAgent**: Creates official company email addresses and sends welcome emails.
- **RepositoryAgent**: Adds the user to the GitHub organization `nucleo-tidz` and grants repository access.
- **ProjectAgent**: Creates a username in the web applicationâ€™s project database to grant project access.

The system uses a **KernelFunctionSelectionStrategy** to orchestrate the agents sequentially, ensuring a smooth onboarding flow.

## Features

- Automated email creation and welcome messaging.
- GitHub organization and repository access provisioning.
- User creation and access grant within project databases.
- Orchestrated multi-agent workflow controlled by a custom function selection strategy.
- Extensible design for adding more onboarding steps or agents.

---

## Technologies Used

- Microsoft Semantic Kernel
- C# .NET 7+
- Azure OpenAI / OpenAI (for chat completions and reasoning)
- GitHub API (simulated or real)
- Relational database or in-memory store (for user/project access)

## How to Use

1. **Set up Semantic Kernel**  
   Clone this repo and install Semantic Kernel NuGet packages.

2. **Configure your Kernel and Agents**  
   Implement and register the three agents: `EmailAgent`, `RepositoryAgent`, and `ProjectAgent`.  
   Configure your Kernel instance with the necessary plugins and APIs (e.g., GitHub integration, email service).

3. **Run the Orchestrator**  
   Use the orchestrator to control which agent acts next, based on conversation history and workflow state.

4. **Extend or customize**  
   Add additional agents or steps as needed for your onboarding process.

## Sample Code Snippet

```csharp
var orchestrator = new Orchestrator(kernel);
var nextAgentName = orchestrator.DetermineNextAgent(conversationHistory);

var agent = kernel.GetAgent(nextAgentName);
agent.Run(...);
